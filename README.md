# Autonomous SLAM Robot for Hospital Mapping and Delivery (NixBot)

## Overview

This project is aimed at developing an autonomous robot utilizing ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in hospital environments. The robot is designed to navigate through hospital corridors, map its surroundings, and deliver items autonomously. 

## Features

- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: The robot employs SLAM algorithms to create a map of its environment while simultaneously determining its own position within that environment.
  
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Utilizing sensor data and mapping information, the robot navigates autonomously through hospital corridors and rooms, avoiding obstacles and dynamically planning paths.
  
- **Delivery System**: The robot is equipped with a delivery mechanism to transport items within the hospital premises. It is capable of picking up and dropping off items at designated locations.

## Prerequisites

- **ROS 2**: Ensure that ROS 2 is installed on your system. You can refer to the [ROS 2 installation instructions](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/) for guidance.

- **Hardware**: The project may require specific hardware components such as Raspberry Pi 4B, LiDAR, motor controllers (Arduino), and a mobile base. Ensure that the hardware setup is compatible and properly configured.
